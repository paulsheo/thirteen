# Environmental Variable 

1. Create a file at the root of the project 
```
.env
```

2. Inside the .env file add the text: 
- you must use `NEXT_PUBLIC` or else this will not work 

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_TITLE = "Digital Design and Development Diploma" 
```

3. On the page, in between the export and return write the variable: 
```
var title = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TITLE 
```
4. Then in between the main write: 
```
{title}
```

5. Make sure the `.gitignore` file has the `.env` inside 
- You want to prevent this secret title to be shown
